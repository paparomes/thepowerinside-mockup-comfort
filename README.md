## Philosophy Behind "Therapeutic Balance"

The Therapeutic Balance design creates a serene yet warm digital environment that serves as a 
transitional space between a potential client's distress and their first step toward healing. 

### Color Psychology
- **Primary Blue (#5A87AD)**: This serene blue establishes psychological safety while projecting 
  professional competence. Unlike clinical blues, this shade has enough warmth to feel inviting rather 
  than institutional.
- **Secondary Sand (#D4B595)**: Introduces warmth and human connection, balancing the cooler blue to 
  create a harmonious visual experience that feels grounded and accessible.
- **Accent Sage (#7B9E89)**: Represents growth and renewal without the intensity of brighter greens, 
  subtly reinforcing the transformative nature of the therapeutic journey.

### Structural Approach
This design employs a linear narrative structure that guides visitors through a logical progression:
1. **Immediate emotional connection** via the hero section's calming imagery and reassuring headline
2. **Clear service distinction** between therapy and coaching, allowing visitors to self-identify their needs
3. **Credential presentation** that builds trust through professional expertise without overwhelming
4. **Social proof** through carefully anonymized testimonials
5. **Low-pressure invitation** to make contact through a form designed to reduce anxiety

### Typography Strategy
The Merrifield Pro/Source Sans Pro pairing creates a balance between authority and accessibility:
- **Merrifield Pro**: Its subtle serifs convey established expertise while remaining approachable 
  through its open letterforms
- **Source Sans Pro**: Highly readable across languages with friendly, open characteristics that 
  support multilingual content without visual friction

This design prioritizes emotional containment through its structured layout, soothing color palette, 
and balanced visual hierarchyâ€”creating a digital space where potential clients can feel both the 
practitioner's expertise and genuine compassion.
